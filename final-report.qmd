The significant dip observed in 2017 across all three ad characteristics may be attributed to various factors, including the political climate. As political tensions escalated with the onset of the Trump administration, advertisers may have shifted their focus towards more politically charged or socially conscious messaging, resulting in a decrease in the prevalence of traditional ad characteristics in Super Bowl commercials during this time. 

Interestingly, these trends are most prominent within the beer and automobile industries, reflecting the strategic importance of Super Bowl advertising for brands within these sectors. The high-stakes nature of the Super Bowl, combined with its massive audience reach, makes it an ideal platform for beer and automobile brands to showcase their products, connect with consumers, and solidify their brand identities in highly competitive markets.
